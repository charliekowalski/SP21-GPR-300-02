Graphics II Final Project Notes

Topic: Water Shader
Engine: Unity (3D) 2020.2.7f1

Ideas:
	. Height map for white salt parts in waves
	. Move the vertices up and down in the VS to simulate moving waves (update height map and therefore colour accordingly)
	. Interpolate (spline interp) vertices?
	. Bloom or Blur when underwater and looking at the light source
	. Hierarchies using scene objects? (consider, otherwise justify why not)

Final Product Ideas:
	. Beach scene in order of importance (inspired by https://photos.com/featured/umbrella-in-sand-on-empty-beach-hybrid-images.html)
		. Water with waves shader (interp vertices in VS, change colour --> whiter as the verts are higher - use height map, look like salt)
		. Sand shader (static, brown with dots of white, yellow, and black everywhere)
		. Umbrella to demonstrate shadows (model or just thin long cube and thicc short cube on top)
		. Skeleton dancing on sand
		. Sun in the sky, blur/bloom when underwater
