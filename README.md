# animal3D-SDK-202101SP
animal3D SDK and related course frameworks for spring 2021.

Project 1 demonstrates the implementation of the basic 3D object rendering pipeline. We implement *solid colour shading, texture rendering onto 3D objects, Lambertian shading, and Phong shading*. Vertex and Fragment shaders are generic and work with a variety of different files, as long as the right uniform names are used in the shaders.


**Controls and usage:** After running the Visual Studio project and having the Animal3D framework open, select File > DEBUG: Demo project hot build & load... > Quick build & load. When the program load successfully, you can use the WASDQE keys to move the camera around the world. Left clicking and dragging will rotate the camera with the mouse axes movement. Using the J and K keys will allow you to change between the rendering and shading modes: Solid Colour, Texture, Lambert, Phong. You will see that the objects rotate around their Y axis in all of the modes.
