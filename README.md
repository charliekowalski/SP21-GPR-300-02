# animal3D-SDK-202101SP
animal3D SDK and related course frameworks for spring 2021.

This tutorial introcudes us to basic colour and 2D shape rendering in OpenGL with the *Animal3D* framework. After running the Visual Studio project and having the Animal3D framework open, select File > DEBUG: Demo project hot build & load... > Quick build & load. When the program load successfully, you will see a background with colours changiong over time (using the sin and cos functions of time for the R and G channels of the RGBA). On top will be a small cyan square drawn in the center of the screen.
