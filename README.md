# animal3D-SDK-202101SP
animal3D SDK and related course frameworks for spring 2021.

Project 5 demonstrates the basics of **Animation Programming** through the use of **Skeletal Animation** and **Morph Target Interpolation**. The program demonstrates a teapot morphing into different shapes, which results from its interpolation through 5 different *Morph Targets* (think of them like keyframes in animation). You will also notice a skeleton animating (translating and rotating) in the world, with the colour of the "bones" representing the depth of the Joint indices in the Hierarchy (depth in the tree). The skeleton looks the way it does because we use **Forward Kinematics** to properly calculate the world positions of all the joints using their parent joint's world transform multiplied by the current joint's local transform, with the exception of the root joint (root node), whose global position is equal to its local position. The movement (animation) is achieved through the interpolation (LERP) of the position, euler angles, and scale from one keyframe to the next (we have a fixed array of them through which we iterate and interpolate).


**Controls and usage:** After running the Visual Studio project and having the Animal3D framework open, select File > DEBUG: Demo project hot build & load... > Quick build & load. If the program load successfully, you should be able to use the WASDQE keys to move the camera around the world. Left clicking and dragging will rotate the camera with the mouse axes movement. You do not need to change Render Modes or anything, the right mode is already loaded. All you should do is explore and inspect to your heart's desire.
