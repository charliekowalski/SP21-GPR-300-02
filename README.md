# animal3D-SDK-202101SP
animal3D SDK and related course frameworks for spring 2021.

Project 4 demonstrates the implementation of **Spline Interpolation** , **Tessellation**, as well as the use of **Geometry Shaders**. The program demonstrates a teapot following a cuved path (using Catmull Rom spline interpolation) that is drawn using ISO Lines, each line being a patch composed of two vertices, one for each end point. Upon loading the demo, you will see the teapot following the path, orbiting around the earth in the center. The default rendering mode is Phong with Normal Mapping, but when you go to the next mode, you will see Phong with Parallax Occlusion Mapping (or POM), a Level of Detail technique that creates the illusion of depth without changing the geometry. The next and final rendering mode is another LOD technique that actually changes the geomtry of the objects in order to get more details, this being done by tessellating our models and adding a displacement vector to the vertices (according to the height map) using Triangular Patches. Object Tangent Bases are also represented, and can be done so by visualising the debugging tools (see controls).


**Controls and usage:** After running the Visual Studio project and having the Animal3D framework open, select File > DEBUG: Demo project hot build & load... > Quick build & load. If the program load successfully, you should be able to use the WASDQE keys to move the camera around the world. Left clicking and dragging will rotate the camera with the mouse axes movement. Using the 'j' and 'k' keys should allow you to change between Rendering Modes (Phong Normal Mapping, Phong POM, and Phong LOD). Pressing 'F' or 'B' will allow you to see the wireframe of the models, as well as the Tangent bases for each vertex (Tangent, Bitangent, and normal). You can see that in the Phong LOD effect, there is in fact a lot more geometry being generated to obtain the effect in comparison to the base Phong NM, whereas Phong POM creates no extra geometry to obtain more detailed models.
