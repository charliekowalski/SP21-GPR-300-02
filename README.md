# animal3D-SDK-202101SP
animal3D SDK and related course frameworks for spring 2021.

Project 3 is supposed to demonstrate the implementation of the **Deferred Lighting and Shading** screen-space rendering techniques, as well as **Phong Shading with Normal Mapping** and the use and outputs of **Geometry Buffers** (g-buffers). Unfortunately this week we have nothing other than code to show, as we got stuck on the implementation and completion of the C and C++ code implementation in the Animal3D framework, and therefore do not have a completed rendering pipeline (we cannot send the proper data to the shaders), and as a result have no way to visualizing our Shader Programs.


**Controls and usage:** After running the Visual Studio project and having the Animal3D framework open, select File > DEBUG: Demo project hot build & load... > Quick build & load. If the program load successfully, you should be able to use the WASDQE keys to move the camera around the world. Left clicking and dragging will rotate the camera with the mouse axes movement. Using the j and k keys should allow you to change between lighting and shading modes, J and K let you ..., and N and M .... Sadly we cannot test our work, so you can instead selecct File > ....
